## Description

Working in culture jobs is often badly paid and has a bad reputation in the population in regard to being of importance to society. But doesn't culture contribute to the well-being of a country? This projects analyzes how properties measuring the cultural capital (Bourdieu) in a country influence KPIs that measure wellbeing of a country's population like GDP.
I want to find such properties and KPIs and investigate the interaction them in order to find out whether attitude towards culture in society should be revaluated.
