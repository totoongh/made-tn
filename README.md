# The influence of personality on happiness: A country-level investigation

[Final report](project/report.html)

## Introduction
This project explores the intriguing intersection of personality assessments and happiness metrics. Utilizing the 16 Personality Factors (16PF) questionnaire and the World Happiness Report's Ladder Score, the study aims to investigate potential correlations between specific personality factors and perceived happiness on a country-aggregated level.

## Objective
The primary goal of this exploratory project is to analyze the relationship between countries' on-average responses to the 16PF questionnaire and their respective World Happiness Report's Ladder Score. By doing so, we hope to shed light on how different personality traits may influence overall well-being.

## Methodology
We employed two key datasets in our analysis:

- Cattell's 16 Personality Factors Test from OpenPsychometrics.org
World Happiness Report 2023 by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network
- The project involved comprehensive data preparation, including extraction, filtering, and aggregation. Correlation analyses were conducted to understand the relationship between the ladder scores of countries and their average responses to the 16PF questions.

## Results
Our findings reveal a range of correlations, from low to high, between the 16PF personality factors and the ladder scores. Notably, a few questions exhibited significant correlations, providing intriguing insights into the complex relationship between personality traits and perceived happiness.

## Conclusions
Establishing psychology- and sociology-grounded interpretations of the correlation patterns proved to be hard and contradictive, and no clear underlying pattern could be identified that explains the observed correlations.
